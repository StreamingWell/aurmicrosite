Xtandi&trade; (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information - For full prescribi=
ng information please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Presentation: Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each containing 40 mg of =
enzalutamide.

Indication: Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatment of adult men wit=
h metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progr=
essed on or after docetaxel therapy

Posology and method of administration: Adults and elderly (=E2=89=A5 65 y=
ears of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg cap=
sules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient misses taking Xtandi&tra=
de; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as po=
ssible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose for a whole day, tr=
eatment should be resumed the following day with the usual daily dose.
If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable a=
dverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until symptoms=
 improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced dose=
 (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.

Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.

Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mil=
d hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hepati=
c impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe he=
patic impairment.

Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild =
or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with severe=
 renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:There=
 is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contrace=
ption in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or its m=
etabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3 mo=
nths after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexua=
l activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual interc=
ourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another form o=
f birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. Stu=
dies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of =
the excipients.
	Women who are or may become pregnant.

	Warnings and Precautions: Caution should be used in administering Xtandi=
&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or otherpredisposing facto=
rs. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased in patients receivi=
ng concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizure threshold. The A=
FFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction, unstable=
 angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncontrolled hypertension=
. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; is prescribed in the=
se patients. =


	Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary pr=
oblems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.

	Drug interactions: Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g=
. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enz=
alutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 =
inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once daily=
 CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. No dose adj=
ustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administered with inhibitor=
s or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and incr=
eases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interact=
ion with many common medicinal products that are substrates of enzymes or=
 transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced include CYP3A4 in =
the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucu=
ronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). The transpor=
t protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as we=
ll, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), breast cancer =
resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1=
B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong in=
ducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The full in=
duction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 mon=
th after the start of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations =
of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction effects may be appar=
ent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of CY=
P3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be evaluated for possible =
loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where ac=
tive metabolites are formed) during the first month of enzalutamide treat=
ment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. If their t=
herapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustm=
ents are not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma c=
oncentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoided or used with ca=
ution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days),=
 effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longer after stopping en=
zalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitant medicinal product=
 may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment. In vitro data ind=
icate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-g=
p. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has not been evaluated i=
n vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an=
 inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor (PXR). M=
edicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for=
 P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used wit=
h caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&trade; and may requ=
ire dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.
		The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytoto=
xic chemotherapy has not been established.

		Undesirable effects:  Very Common (=E2=89=A5 1/10): headache, hot flush=
; Common (=E2=89=A5 1/100 to < 1/10): neutropenia, visual hallucinations,=
 anxiety, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, hypertension, dry skin,=
 pruritus, fractures, falls; Uncommon (=E2=89=A5 1/1,000 to < 1/100): leu=
copenia, seizure, amnesia, disturbance in attention. (In the AFFIRM study=
, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 patients treated w=
ith a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide).

		Packs and Cost: 40mg capsules x 112: =C2=A32,734.67 Legal Classificatio=

<p><strong>Xtandi&trade;</span> (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information -<=
/strong> For full prescribing information please refer to the Summary of =
Product Characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each =
containing 40 mg of enzalutamide.</p>

<p><strong>Indication:</strong> Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatm=
ent of adult men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who=
se disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy</p>

<p><strong>Posology and method of administration:</strong> Adults and eld=
erly (=E2=89=A5 65 years of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzaluta=
mide (four 40 mg capsules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient miss=
es taking Xtandi&trade; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be =
taken as close as possible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose=
 for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the following day with the =
usual daily dose.</p>
<p>If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerabl=
e adverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until sympt=
oms improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced d=
ose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.</p>

<p>Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.</p>

<p>Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with =
mild hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hep=
atic impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe=
 hepatic impairment.</p>

<p>Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mi=
ld or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with sev=
ere renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:Th=
ere is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contr=
aception in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or it=
s metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3=
 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in se=
xual activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual int=
ercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another for=
m of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. =
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.</p>

<p><strong>Contraindications:</strong> Hypersensitivity to the active sub=
stance or to any of the excipients.
Women who are or may become pregnant.</p>

<p><strong>Warnings and Precautions:</strong> Caution should be used in a=
dministering Xtandi&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or othe=
rpredisposing factors. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased =
in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizu=
re threshold. The AFFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial i=
nfarction, unstable angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncont=
rolled hypertension. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; i=
s prescribed in these patients. </p>

<p>Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary =
problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.<=
/p>

<p><strong>Drug interactions:</strong> Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozi=
l) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with=
 caution during enzalutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administer=
ed a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced =
to 80 mg once daily CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalu=
tamide. No dose adjustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administ=
ered with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzy=
me inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; =
therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are subst=
rates of enzymes or transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced=
 include CYP3A4 in the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine=
 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enz=
ymes). The transport protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other=
 transporters as well, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MR=
P2), breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transpo=
rting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzaluta=
mide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and C=
YP2C19. The full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until =
approximately 1 month after the start of treatment, when steady-state pla=
sma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction e=
ffects may be apparent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that a=
re substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be eval=
uated for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effect=
s in cases where active metabolites are formed) during the first month of=
 enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appr=
opriate. If their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patien=
t, and dose adjustments are not easily performed based on monitoring of e=
fficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoi=
ded or used with caution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzal=
utamide (5.8 days), effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longe=
r after stopping enzalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitan=
t medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment=
. In vitro data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the eff=
lux transporter P-gp. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has n=
ot been evaluated in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enz=
alutamide may be an inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnan=
e receptor (PXR). Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that=
 are substrates for P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin)=
 should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&=
trade; and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concent=
rations.
The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytotoxi=
c chemotherapy has not been established.</p>

<p><strong>Undesirable effects:</strong>  Very Common (=E2=89=A5 1/10): h=
eadache, hot flush; Common (=E2=89=A5 1/100 to < 1/10): neutropenia, visu=
al hallucinations, anxiety, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, hyper=
tension, dry skin, pruritus, fractures, falls; Uncommon (=E2=89=A5 1/1,00=
0 to < 1/100): leucopenia, seizure, amnesia, disturbance in attention. (I=
n the AFFIRM study, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 =
patients treated with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide).</p>

Xtandi&trade; (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information - For full prescribi=
ng information please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Presentation: Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each containing 40 mg of =
enzalutamide.

Indication: Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatment of adult men wit=
h metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progr=
essed on or after docetaxel therapy

Posology and method of administration: Adults and elderly (=E2=89=A5 65 y=
ears of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg cap=
sules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient misses taking Xtandi&tra=
de; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as po=
ssible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose for a whole day, tr=
eatment should be resumed the following day with the usual daily dose.
If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable a=
dverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until symptoms=
 improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced dose=
 (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.

Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.

Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mil=
d hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hepati=
c impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe he=
patic impairment.

Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild =
or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with severe=
 renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:There=
 is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contrace=
ption in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or its m=
etabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3 mo=
nths after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexua=
l activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual interc=
ourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another form o=
f birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. Stu=
dies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of =
the excipients.
	Women who are or may become pregnant.

	Warnings and Precautions: Caution should be used in administering Xtandi=
&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or otherpredisposing facto=
rs. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased in patients receivi=
ng concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizure threshold. The A=
FFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction, unstable=
 angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncontrolled hypertension=
. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; is prescribed in the=
se patients. =


	Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary pr=
oblems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.

	Drug interactions: Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g=
. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enz=
alutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 =
inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once daily=
 CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. No dose adj=
ustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administered with inhibitor=
s or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and incr=
eases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interact=
ion with many common medicinal products that are substrates of enzymes or=
 transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced include CYP3A4 in =
the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucu=
ronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). The transpor=
t protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as we=
ll, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), breast cancer =
resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1=
B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong in=
ducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The full in=
duction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 mon=
th after the start of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations =
of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction effects may be appar=
ent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of CY=
P3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be evaluated for possible =
loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where ac=
tive metabolites are formed) during the first month of enzalutamide treat=
ment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. If their t=
herapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustm=
ents are not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma c=
oncentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoided or used with ca=
ution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days),=
 effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longer after stopping en=
zalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitant medicinal product=
 may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment. In vitro data ind=
icate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-g=
p. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has not been evaluated i=
n vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an=
 inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor (PXR). M=
edicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for=
 P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used wit=
h caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&trade; and may requ=
ire dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.
		The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytoto=
xic chemotherapy has not been established.

		Undesirable effects:  Very Common (=E2=89=A5 1/10): headache, hot flush=
; Common (=E2=89=A5 1/100 to < 1/10): neutropenia, visual hallucinations,=
 anxiety, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, hypertension, dry skin,=
 pruritus, fractures, falls; Uncommon (=E2=89=A5 1/1,000 to < 1/100): leu=
copenia, seizure, amnesia, disturbance in attention. (In the AFFIRM study=
, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 patients treated w=
ith a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide).

		Packs and Cost: 40mg capsules x 112: =C2=A32,734.67 Legal Classificatio=
n: POM. Marketing authorisation number: EU/1/13/846/001

<p><strong>Xtandi&trade;</span> (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information -<=
/strong> For full prescribing information please refer to the Summary of =
Product Characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each =
containing 40 mg of enzalutamide.</p>

<p><strong>Indication:</strong> Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatm=
ent of adult men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who=
se disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy</p>

<p><strong>Posology and method of administration:</strong> Adults and eld=
erly (=E2=89=A5 65 years of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzaluta=
mide (four 40 mg capsules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient miss=
es taking Xtandi&trade; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be =
taken as close as possible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose=
 for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the following day with the =
usual daily dose.</p>
<p>If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerabl=
e adverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until sympt=
oms improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced d=
ose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.</p>

<p>Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.</p>

<p>Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with =
mild hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hep=
atic impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe=
 hepatic impairment.</p>

<p>Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mi=
ld or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with sev=
ere renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:Th=
ere is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contr=
aception in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or it=
s metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3=
 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in se=
xual activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual int=
ercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another for=
m of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. =
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.</p>

<p><strong>Contraindications:</strong> Hypersensitivity to the active sub=
stance or to any of the excipients.
Women who are or may become pregnant.</p>

<p><strong>Warnings and Precautions:</strong> Caution should be used in a=
dministering Xtandi&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or othe=
rpredisposing factors. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased =
in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizu=
re threshold. The AFFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial i=
nfarction, unstable angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncont=
rolled hypertension. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; i=
s prescribed in these patients. </p>

<p>Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary =
problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.<=
/p>

<p><strong>Drug interactions:</strong> Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozi=
l) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with=
 caution during enzalutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administer=
ed a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced =
to 80 mg once daily CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalu=
tamide. No dose adjustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administ=
ered with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzy=
me inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; =
therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are subst=
rates of enzymes or transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced=
 include CYP3A4 in the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine=
 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enz=
ymes). The transport protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other=
 transporters as well, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MR=
P2), breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transpo=
rting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzaluta=
mide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and C=
YP2C19. The full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until =
approximately 1 month after the start of treatment, when steady-state pla=
sma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction e=
ffects may be apparent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that a=
re substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be eval=
uated for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effect=
s in cases where active metabolites are formed) during the first month of=
 enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appr=
opriate. If their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patien=
t, and dose adjustments are not easily performed based on monitoring of e=
fficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoi=
ded or used with caution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzal=
utamide (5.8 days), effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longe=
r after stopping enzalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitan=
t medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment=
. In vitro data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the eff=
lux transporter P-gp. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has n=
ot been evaluated in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enz=
alutamide may be an inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnan=
e receptor (PXR). Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that=
 are substrates for P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin)=
 should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&=
trade; and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concent=
rations.
The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytotoxi=
c chemotherapy has not been established.</p>

<p><strong>Undesirable effects:</strong>  Very Common (=E2=89=A5 1/10): h=
eadache, hot flush; Common (=E2=89=A5 1/100 to < 1/10): neutropenia, visu=
al hallucinations, anxiety, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, hyper=
tension, dry skin, pruritus, fractures, falls; Uncommon (=E2=89=A5 1/1,00=
0 to < 1/100): leucopenia, seizure, amnesia, disturbance in attention. (I=
n the AFFIRM study, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 =
patients treated with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide).</p>

Xtandi&trade; (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information - For full prescribi=
ng information please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Presentation: Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each containing 40 mg of =
enzalutamide.

Indication: Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatment of adult men wit=
h metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progr=
essed on or after docetaxel therapy

Posology and method of administration: Adults and elderly (=E2=89=A5 65 y=
ears of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg cap=
sules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient misses taking Xtandi&tra=
de; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as po=
ssible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose for a whole day, tr=
eatment should be resumed the following day with the usual daily dose.
If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable a=
dverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until symptoms=
 improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced dose=
 (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.

Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.

Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mil=
d hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hepati=
c impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe he=
patic impairment.

Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild =
or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with severe=
 renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:There=
 is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contrace=
ption in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or its m=
etabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3 mo=
nths after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexua=
l activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual interc=
ourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another form o=
f birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. Stu=
dies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of =
the excipients.
	Women who are or may become pregnant.

	Warnings and Precautions: Caution should be used in administering Xtandi=
&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or otherpredisposing facto=
rs. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased in patients receivi=
ng concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizure threshold. The A=
FFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction, unstable=
 angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncontrolled hypertension=
. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; is prescribed in the=
se patients. =


	Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary pr=
oblems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.

	Drug interactions: Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g=
. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enz=
alutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 =
inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once daily=
 CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. No dose adj=
ustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administered with inhibitor=
s or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and incr=
eases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interact=
ion with many common medicinal products that are substrates of enzymes or=
 transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced include CYP3A4 in =
the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucu=
ronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). The transpor=
t protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as we=
ll, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), breast cancer =
resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1=
B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong in=
ducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The full in=
duction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 mon=
th after the start of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations =
of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction effects may be appar=
ent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of CY=
P3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be evaluated for possible =
loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where ac=
tive metabolites are formed) during the first month of enzalutamide treat=
ment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. If their t=
herapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustm=
ents are not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma c=
oncentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoided or used with ca=
ution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days),=
 effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longer after stopping en=
zalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitant medicinal product=
 may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment. In vitro data ind=
icate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-g=
p. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has not been evaluated i=
n vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an=
 inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor (PXR). M=
edicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for=
 P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used wit=
h caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&trade; and may requ=
ire dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.
		The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytoto=
xic chemotherapy has not been established.

		Undesirable effects:  Very Common (=E2=89=A5 1/10): headache, hot flush=
; Common (=E2=89=A5 1/100 to < 1/10): neutropenia, visual hallucinations,=
 anxiety, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, hypertension, dry skin,=
 pruritus, fractures, falls; Uncommon (=E2=89=A5 1/1,000 to < 1/100): leu=
copenia, seizure, amnesia, disturbance in attention. (In the AFFIRM study=
, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 patients treated w=
ith a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide).

<p><strong>Xtandi&trade;</span> (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information -<=
/strong> For full prescribing information please refer to the Summary of =
Product Characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each =
containing 40 mg of enzalutamide.</p>

<p><strong>Indication:</strong> Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatm=
ent of adult men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who=
se disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy</p>

<p><strong>Posology and method of administration:</strong> Adults and eld=
erly (=E2=89=A5 65 years of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzaluta=
mide (four 40 mg capsules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient miss=
es taking Xtandi&trade; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be =
taken as close as possible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose=
 for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the following day with the =
usual daily dose.</p>
<p>If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerabl=
e adverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until sympt=
oms improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced d=
ose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.</p>

<p>Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.</p>

<p>Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with =
mild hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hep=
atic impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe=
 hepatic impairment.</p>

<p>Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mi=
ld or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with sev=
ere renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:Th=
ere is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contr=
aception in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or it=
s metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3=
 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in se=
xual activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual int=
ercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another for=
m of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. =
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.</p>

<p><strong>Contraindications:</strong> Hypersensitivity to the active sub=
stance or to any of the excipients.
Women who are or may become pregnant.</p>

<p><strong>Warnings and Precautions:</strong> Caution should be used in a=
dministering Xtandi&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or othe=
rpredisposing factors. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased =
in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizu=
re threshold. The AFFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial i=
nfarction, unstable angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncont=
rolled hypertension. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; i=
s prescribed in these patients. </p>

<p>Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary =
problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.<=
/p>

<p><strong>Drug interactions:</strong> Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozi=
l) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with=
 caution during enzalutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administer=
ed a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced =
to 80 mg once daily CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalu=
tamide. No dose adjustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administ=
ered with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzy=
me inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; =
therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are subst=
rates of enzymes or transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced=
 include CYP3A4 in the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine=
 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enz=
ymes). The transport protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other=
 transporters as well, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MR=
P2), breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transpo=
rting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzaluta=
mide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and C=
YP2C19. The full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until =
approximately 1 month after the start of treatment, when steady-state pla=
sma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction e=
ffects may be apparent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that a=
re substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be eval=
uated for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effect=
s in cases where active metabolites are formed) during the first month of=
 enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appr=
opriate. If their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patien=
t, and dose adjustments are not easily performed based on monitoring of e=
fficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoi=
ded or used with caution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzal=
utamide (5.8 days), effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longe=
r after stopping enzalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitan=
t medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment=
. In vitro data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the eff=
lux transporter P-gp. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has n=
ot been evaluated in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enz=
alutamide may be an inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnan=
e receptor (PXR). Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that=
 are substrates for P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin)=
 should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&=
trade; and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concent=
rations.
The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytotoxi=
c chemotherapy has not been established.</p>

<p><strong>Undesirable effects:</strong>  Very Common (=E2=89=A5 1/10): h=
eadache, hot flush; Common (=E2=89=A5 1/100 to < 1/10): neutropenia, visu=
al hallucinations, anxiety, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, hyper=
tension, dry skin, pruritus, fractures, falls; Uncommon (=E2=89=A5 1/1,00=
0 to < 1/100): leucopenia, seizure, amnesia, disturbance in attention. (I=
n the AFFIRM study, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 =
patients treated with a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide).</p>

Xtandi&trade; (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information - For full prescribi=
ng information please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Presentation: Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each containing 40 mg of =
enzalutamide.

Indication: Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatment of adult men wit=
h metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progr=
essed on or after docetaxel therapy

Posology and method of administration: Adults and elderly (=E2=89=A5 65 y=
ears of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg cap=
sules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient misses taking Xtandi&tra=
de; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as po=
ssible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose for a whole day, tr=
eatment should be resumed the following day with the usual daily dose.
If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable a=
dverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until symptoms=
 improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced dose=
 (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.

Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.

Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mil=
d hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hepati=
c impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe he=
patic impairment.

Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild =
or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with severe=
 renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:There=
 is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contrace=
ption in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or its m=
etabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3 mo=
nths after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexua=
l activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual interc=
ourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another form o=
f birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. Stu=
dies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of =
the excipients.
	Women who are or may become pregnant.

	Warnings and Precautions: Caution should be used in administering Xtandi=
&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or otherpredisposing facto=
rs. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased in patients receivi=
ng concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizure threshold. The A=
FFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction, unstable=
 angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncontrolled hypertension=
. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; is prescribed in the=
se patients. =


	Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary pr=
oblems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.

	Drug interactions: Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g=
. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enz=
alutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 =
inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once daily=
 CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. No dose adj=
ustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administered with inhibitor=
s or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and incr=
eases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interact=
ion with many common medicinal products that are substrates of enzymes or=
 transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced include CYP3A4 in =
the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucu=
ronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). The transpor=
t protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as we=
ll, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), breast cancer =
resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1=
B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong in=
ducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The full in=
duction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 mon=
th after the start of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations =
of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction effects may be appar=
ent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of CY=
P3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be evaluated for possible =
loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where ac=
tive metabolites are formed) during the first month of enzalutamide treat=
ment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. If their t=
herapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustm=
ents are not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma c=
oncentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoided or used with ca=
ution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days),=
 effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longer after stopping en=
zalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitant medicinal product=
 may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment. In vitro data ind=
icate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-g=
p. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has not been evaluated i=
n vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an=
 inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor (PXR). M=
edicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for=
 P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used wit=
h caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&trade; and may requ=
ire dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.
		The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytoto=
xic chemotherapy has not been established.

		Undesirable effects:  Very Common (=E2=89=A5 1/10): headache, hot flush=
; Common (=E2=89=A5 1/100 to < 1/10): neutropenia, visual hallucinations,=
 anxiety, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, hypertension, dry skin,=
 pruritus, fractures, falls; Uncommon (=E2=89=A5 1/1,000 to < 1/100): leu=
copenia, seizure, amnesia, disturbance in attention. (In the AFFIRM study=
, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 patients treated w=
ith a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide).

<p><strong>Xtandi&trade;</span> (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information -<=
/strong> For full prescribing information please refer to the Summary of =
Product Characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each =
containing 40 mg of enzalutamide.</p>

<p><strong>Indication:</strong> Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatm=
ent of adult men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who=
se disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy</p>

<p><strong>Posology and method of administration:</strong> Adults and eld=
erly (=E2=89=A5 65 years of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzaluta=
mide (four 40 mg capsules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient miss=
es taking Xtandi&trade; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be =
taken as close as possible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose=
 for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the following day with the =
usual daily dose.</p>
<p>If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerabl=
e adverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until sympt=
oms improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced d=
ose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.</p>

<p>Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.</p>

<p>Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with =
mild hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hep=
atic impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe=
 hepatic impairment.</p>

<p>Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mi=
ld or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with sev=
ere renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:Th=
ere is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contr=
aception in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or it=
s metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3=
 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in se=
xual activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual int=
ercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another for=
m of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. =
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.</p>

<p><strong>Contraindications:</strong> Hypersensitivity to the active sub=
stance or to any of the excipients.
Women who are or may become pregnant.</p>

<p><strong>Warnings and Precautions:</strong> Caution should be used in a=
dministering Xtandi&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or othe=
rpredisposing factors. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased =
in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizu=
re threshold. The AFFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial i=
nfarction, unstable angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncont=
rolled hypertension. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; i=
s prescribed in these patients. </p>

<p>Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary =
problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.<=
/p>

<p><strong>Drug interactions:</strong> Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozi=
l) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with=
 caution during enzalutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administer=
ed a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced =
to 80 mg once daily CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalu=
tamide. No dose adjustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administ=
ered with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzy=
me inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; =
therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are subst=
rates of enzymes or transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced=
 include CYP3A4 in the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine=
 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enz=
ymes). The transport protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other=
 transporters as well, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MR=
P2), breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transpo=
rting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzaluta=
mide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and C=
YP2C19. The full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until =
approximately 1 month after the start of treatment, when steady-state pla=
sma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction e=
ffects may be apparent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that a=
re substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be eval=
uated for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effect=
s in cases where active metabolites are formed) during the first month of=
 enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appr=
opriate. If their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patien=
t, and dose adjustments are not easily performed based on monitoring of e=
fficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoi=
ded or used with caution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzal=
utamide (5.8 days), effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longe=
r after stopping enzalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitan=
t medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment=
. In vitro data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the eff=
lux transporter P-gp. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has n=
ot been evaluated in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enz=
alutamide may be an inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnan=
e receptor (PXR). Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that=
 are substrates for P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin)=
 should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&=
trade; and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concent=
rations.
The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytotoxi=
c chemotherapy has not been established.</p>

Xtandi&trade; (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information - For full prescribi=
ng information please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Presentation: Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each containing 40 mg of =
enzalutamide.

Indication: Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatment of adult men wit=
h metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progr=
essed on or after docetaxel therapy

Posology and method of administration: Adults and elderly (=E2=89=A5 65 y=
ears of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg cap=
sules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient misses taking Xtandi&tra=
de; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be taken as close as po=
ssible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose for a whole day, tr=
eatment should be resumed the following day with the usual daily dose.
If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable a=
dverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until symptoms=
 improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced dose=
 (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.

Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.

Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mil=
d hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hepati=
c impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe he=
patic impairment.

Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild =
or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with severe=
 renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:There=
 is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contrace=
ption in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or its m=
etabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3 mo=
nths after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in sexua=
l activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual interc=
ourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another form o=
f birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. Stu=
dies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.

Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of =
the excipients.
	Women who are or may become pregnant.

	Warnings and Precautions: Caution should be used in administering Xtandi=
&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or otherpredisposing facto=
rs. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased in patients receivi=
ng concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizure threshold. The A=
FFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial infarction, unstable=
 angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncontrolled hypertension=
. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; is prescribed in the=
se patients. =


	Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary pr=
oblems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.

	Drug interactions: Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g=
. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with caution during enz=
alutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP2C8 =
inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mg once daily=
 CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalutamide. No dose adj=
ustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administered with inhibitor=
s or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzyme inducer and incr=
eases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; therefore, interact=
ion with many common medicinal products that are substrates of enzymes or=
 transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced include CYP3A4 in =
the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucu=
ronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enzymes). The transpor=
t protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other transporters as we=
ll, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), breast cancer =
resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1=
B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzalutamide is a strong in=
ducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. The full in=
duction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until approximately 1 mon=
th after the start of treatment, when steady-state plasma concentrations =
of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction effects may be appar=
ent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that are substrates of CY=
P3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be evaluated for possible =
loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effects in cases where ac=
tive metabolites are formed) during the first month of enzalutamide treat=
ment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appropriate. If their t=
herapeutic effect is of large importance to the patient, and dose adjustm=
ents are not easily performed based on monitoring of efficacy or plasma c=
oncentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoided or used with ca=
ution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzalutamide (5.8 days),=
 effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longer after stopping en=
zalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitant medicinal product=
 may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment. In vitro data ind=
icate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-g=
p. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has not been evaluated i=
n vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enzalutamide may be an=
 inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnane receptor (PXR). M=
edicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for=
 P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin) should be used wit=
h caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&trade; and may requ=
ire dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concentrations.
		The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytoto=
xic chemotherapy has not been established.

		Undesirable effects:  Very Common (=E2=89=A5 1/10): headache, hot flush=
; Common (=E2=89=A5 1/100 to < 1/10): neutropenia, visual hallucinations,=
 anxiety, cognitive disorders, memory impairment, hypertension, dry skin,=
 pruritus, fractures, falls; Uncommon (=E2=89=A5 1/1,000 to < 1/100): leu=
copenia, seizure, amnesia, disturbance in attention. (In the AFFIRM study=
, six patients (0.8%) experienced a seizure out of 800 patients treated w=
ith a daily dose of 160 mg enzalutamide).

<p><strong>Xtandi&trade;</span> (enzalutamide) Prescribing Information -<=
/strong> For full prescribing information please refer to the Summary of =
Product Characteristics.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation:</strong> Xtandi&trade; 40 mg soft capsules each =
containing 40 mg of enzalutamide.</p>

<p><strong>Indication:</strong> Xtandi&trade; is indicated for the treatm=
ent of adult men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who=
se disease has progressed on or after docetaxel therapy</p>

<p><strong>Posology and method of administration:</strong> Adults and eld=
erly (=E2=89=A5 65 years of age): The recommended dose is 160 mg enzaluta=
mide (four 40 mg capsules) as a single oral daily dose. If a patient miss=
es taking Xtandi&trade; at the usual time, the prescribed dose should be =
taken as close as possible to the usual time.  If a patient misses a dose=
 for a whole day, treatment should be resumed the following day with the =
usual daily dose.</p>
<p>If a patient experiences a =E2=89=A5 Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerabl=
e adverse reaction, dosing should be withheld for one week or until sympt=
oms improve to =E2=89=A4 Grade 2, then resumed at the same or a reduced d=
ose (120 mg or 80 mg) if warranted.</p>

<p>Older people: No dose adjustment is necessary for older people.</p>

<p>Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with =
mild hepatic impairment; caution is advised in patients with moderate hep=
atic impairment; Xtandi&trade; is not recommended in patients with severe=
 hepatic impairment.</p>

<p>Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mi=
ld or moderate renal impairment.  Caution is advised in patients with sev=
ere renal impairment or end stage renal disease. Paediatric population:Th=
ere is no relevant use of enzalutamide in the paediatric population.Contr=
aception in males and females: It is not known whether enzalutamide or it=
s metabolites are present in semen. A condom is required during and for 3=
 months after treatment with enzalutamide if the patient is engaged in se=
xual activity with a pregnant woman. If the patient engages in sexual int=
ercourse with a woman of childbearing potential, a condom and another for=
m of birth control must be used during and for 3 months after treatment. =
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.</p>

<p><strong>Contraindications:</strong> Hypersensitivity to the active sub=
stance or to any of the excipients.
Women who are or may become pregnant.</p>

<p><strong>Warnings and Precautions:</strong> Caution should be used in a=
dministering Xtandi&trade; to patients with a history of seizures or othe=
rpredisposing factors. In addition, the risk of seizure may be increased =
in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products that lower the seizu=
re threshold. The AFFIRM study excluded patients with recent myocardial i=
nfarction, unstable angina, heart failure, long QT, bradycardia or uncont=
rolled hypertension. This should be taken into account if Xtandi&trade; i=
s prescribed in these patients. </p>

<p>Xtandi&trade; contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary =
problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicinal product.<=
/p>

<p><strong>Drug interactions:</strong> Strong inhibitors (e.g. gemfibrozi=
l) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) of CYP2C8 are to be avoided or used with=
 caution during enzalutamide treatment. If patients must be co-administer=
ed a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should be reduced =
to 80 mg once daily CYP3A4 plays a minor role in the metabolism of enzalu=
tamide. No dose adjustment is necessary when Xtandi&trade; is co-administ=
ered with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. Enzalutamide is a potent enzy=
me inducer and increases the synthesis of many enzymes and transporters; =
therefore, interaction with many common medicinal products that are subst=
rates of enzymes or transporters is expected. Enzymes that may be induced=
 include CYP3A4 in the liver and gut, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 and uridine=
 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs - glucuronide conjugating enz=
ymes). The transport protein P-gp may also be induced, and probably other=
 transporters as well, e.g. multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MR=
P2), breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and the organic anion transpo=
rting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). In vivo studies have shown that enzaluta=
mide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and C=
YP2C19. The full induction potential of enzalutamide may not occur until =
approximately 1 month after the start of treatment, when steady-state pla=
sma concentrations of enzalutamide are reached, although some induction e=
ffects may be apparent earlier. Patients taking medicinal products that a=
re substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2 or UGT1A1 should be eval=
uated for possible loss of pharmacological effects (or increase in effect=
s in cases where active metabolites are formed) during the first month of=
 enzalutamide treatment, and dose adjustment should be considered as appr=
opriate. If their therapeutic effect is of large importance to the patien=
t, and dose adjustments are not easily performed based on monitoring of e=
fficacy or plasma concentrations, these medicinal products are to be avoi=
ded or used with caution. In consideration of the long half-life of enzal=
utamide (5.8 days), effects on enzymes may persist for one month or longe=
r after stopping enzalutamide. A gradual dose reduction of the concomitan=
t medicinal product may be necessary when stopping enzalutamide treatment=
. In vitro data indicate that enzalutamide may be an inhibitor of the eff=
lux transporter P-gp. The effect of enzalutamide on P-gp substrates has n=
ot been evaluated in vivo; however, under conditions of clinical use, enz=
alutamide may be an inducer of P-gp via activation of the nuclear pregnan=
e receptor (PXR). Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that=
 are substrates for P-gp (e.g. colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin)=
 should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with Xtandi&=
trade; and may require dose adjustment to maintain optimal plasma concent=
rations.
The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of Xtandi&trade; with cytotoxi=
c chemotherapy has not been established.</p>
